# apricot
A next-generation browser engine made in Red.

## Why should this even exist?

It's about time something other than a CLI engine or Chromium/Gecko existed. There's a clear demand for something hackable that isn't political, and simply "works".

## Why Red?

I'm quickly realizing that Red is the greatest programming language to exist since the 70s. It's everything good about C & Haskell, but better.

## Upcoming features of Apricot:

- Normal Web Surfing
- TUUP Compatibility
- Ability to Use Web3 Domains Out-of-the-Box
- Built-In Ad Blocking / Whitelisting
- Built-In Torrent Client
